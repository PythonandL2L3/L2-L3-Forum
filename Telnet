  **Firstly create an virtual interface if it is ubuntu laptop. 
  Steps to create virtual interface...
       1.open the terminal.
       2.Enter the following commands...
                 sudo tunctl -u <login account>
                 sudo tunctl -u <1000>
                 sudo ifconfig tap1 <your own ip address> netmask <your own mask address> up
       After this enter the 'ifconfig' & check whether tap1 came or not.
       
       Next Put a cloud in gns3 set up & configure tap1 interface.That's it. After this configure telnet in router...steps are as follows..
         
         Go to conf mode & enter the commands 
                  1.username <your name> password <your password>
                  2.line vty 0 4
                  3.login local
